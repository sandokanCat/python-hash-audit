# Code of Conduct

## Statement of Principles

This project adheres to the principles of **Liberty**, **Meritocracy**, and **Technical Excellence**.

Our goal is to build high-quality, robust, and verifiable software. We believe the best way to achieve this is by fostering an environment where ideas can be freely debated based on their technical merit, objectivity, and logic, regardless of who proposes them.

## Behavioral Guidelines

1. **Judge the code, not the person**: Contributions are evaluated exclusively on their technical quality, correctness, and utility to the project. The author's identity, ideology, or beliefs are irrelevant to the review process.
2. **Technical Free Speech**: We encourage open debate. Disagreement is a natural part of development. Arguments are expected to be defended with data and reasons, not appeals to emotion or authority.
3. **Individual Responsibility**: Each contributor is responsible for their words and actions. We expect professionalism and courtesy, but we do not shield anyone from legitimate criticism of their work.
4. **No Ideological Bureaucracy**: This repository is for writing code, not for political or social activism of any kind. Let's keep discussions focused on technology.

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts will be resolved based on:

1. Technical truth (what works vs what doesn't).
2. Consistency with the project design.
3. The final decision of the project maintainer.
